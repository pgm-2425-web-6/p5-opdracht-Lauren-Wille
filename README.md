# Welcome to your aquarium!

## What can you do?
Open the menu and add some fish. Once you've added them, you can click on them to make them stop swimming. You can also "pop" the bubbles by clicking on them.

You can choose which background you'd like to display as well.

Feeling curious? Hover over the info button to learn more about the different types of fish.

Ready and want to show it off to your friends? Save your aquarium as a photo by clicking "save screenshot" in the menu.
